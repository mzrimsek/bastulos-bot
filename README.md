# Bastulos Bot

A bot to interact with Twitch, Discord, and anything else your mind (and my freetime) can imagine.

## Commands

### Admin (only work when triggered from Twitch chat)

* !active - toggles whether commands work or not
* !obs - connects the bot to OBS (required for OBS commands to work)
* !add <command> <message> - adds a command (or edits the existing command) with the specified message
* !rm <command> - removes the specified command

### General (work when triggered from both Twitch chat and Discord)

* !help - displays help command (this shows different commands based on where it is triggered from)

### OBS (only work when triggered from Twitch chat)

* !cam - toggles face cam visibility
* !mic - toggles desktop mic active
* !color <number:optional> - changes face cam color overlay color. Optional number parameter causes color to change that many times in 1 second (max 1000)
* !reset - reset face cam and mic changes back to default
* !aqua - toggle Aqua visibility on scenes with her in them
